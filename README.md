# MNIST Handwriiten Digit Recognizer
<p>The MNIST dataset is a well-known and widely used dataset in the machine learning community, particularly for tasks involving image classification. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, which are 28 pixels by 28 pixels in size and represent a single digit from 0 through 9. The images are divided into a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.</p>
<p>By training a machine learning model on the MNIST dataset, we can build a system that is able to recognize handwritten digits from images. This can be useful in a variety of applications, such as automating the process of transcribing handwritten documents or building a system to recognize digits in financial documents.</p>
<p>This project will be divided into 3 main parts:

- Working with images in Python.
- Feature Engineering
- Model Prediction and Evaluation</p>
